  - *Covid Friendly Face Detector* [(CFFD)](https://github.com/Jtachan/CV_projects/blob/main/covid_drowsiness_detector/readme-CFFD.md) 

## Covid Friendly Face Detector (CFFD)
Because of Covid-19 a very common sight is that everyone has a mask outside their homes. 
With the face partially covered, old face detectors might not work.

This project implements a CNN-based face detector with a re-trained 22-face-landmarks shape predictor.
The goal is to being able to detect any face (with or without mask) and predict drowsiness at the detected face.<br />
